We believe the new learning center is a step in the right direction for the future of our educational prowess, but we recognize that it is not perfect, and it currently lacks subjects the original learning center boasted. To overcome our present-day shortcomings, we are committed to continually improve the new learning center, bringing you weekly updates, and new courses of study.
